# Banach Tarski
The Banach-Tarski theorem states the following: Given a sphere in 3D space, you are able to obtain an identical copy of the sphere by decomposing it into a finite number of subsets, rotating them and putting them back together. This repo contains the project to formalise the Banach-Tarksi theorem in Lean4.
